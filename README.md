Requirements: NodeJS 16.x

Step 1: Download source code, containing 2 folders: Server and Booking-app
 
Step 2: Setup the server
● Move to the folder “Server”: cd Server
● Install ExpressJS: npm add Express
● Start the server: two ways:
     + npm run dev: server will restart whenever the source code in folder "Server" has changed
     + npm start: server will not restart whenever the source code in folder "Server" has changed
If the terminal shows “Server is run at port 3002. Connected to mongoDB”, it means that the project’s server is working.
 
Step 3: Setup the client
● Split the terminal and move to the folder “Booking-app”: cd Booking-app
● Install required packages: npm install or npm install --force
● Start the project: npm start
